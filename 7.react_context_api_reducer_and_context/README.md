<p>In this example, the reducer is declared in a context provider and the functions to update state are made available to children components. We could simply pass the <code>dispatch</code> function and call it from any children component that wants to update state, but since we don't have a huge application, it's alright.</p>
<p>The benefits of organising code like this are not immediatly obvious in this playground do to multi-file limitations (we are working on it), so <a href="https://github.com/WebDev-WBSCodingSchool/reducer-context-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check this repo out to see a proposed file structure.</a></p>
