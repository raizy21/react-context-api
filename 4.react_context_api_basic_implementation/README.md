<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a basic implementation of the Context API in React for managing localization (i.e., providing different language translations) in an application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This example will have three main components: <code>App</code>, <code>GeneralLayout,</code> <code>LocalizationProvider</code>, and <code>LocalizedText</code>.<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>LocalizationContext</strong>: This context is created using <code>createContext()</code>. It will hold the current language and translations, and provide a method to switch languages. It returns a Context object that has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Context.Provider</code> a React component that takes a <code>value</code> property that becomes the value of the context, it can wrap children that will have access to the context.</li>
<li><code>Context.Consumer</code> a React componet that was used to consume the context. It's rarely used now since we have a better way, a hook!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LocalizationProvider</strong>: This component manages the state for the current language and provides translations for different languages. It uses the <code>useState</code> hook to manage the current language and provides a <code>switchLanguage</code> function to change the language. The <code>translations</code> object holds the greeting text in different languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LocalizedText</strong>: This component consumes the localization data using the <code>useContext</code> hook and displays the greeting text based on the current language.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LanguageSwitcher</strong>: This component provides buttons to switch between different languages by calling the <code>switchLanguage</code> function from the context.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>GeneralLayout:&nbsp;</strong>It's just here to add a nesting level beween the context provider and the components that consume the context!</li>
</ul>
<p>Context can be used for a LOT of things: authentication data that is needed across the application, localisation, themes! anything! It's just a more efficient way to organise and share state :D&nbsp;</p>
